# Contributing to Wii Shop Channel Music

The Wii Shop Music extension is intended to be a fun and simple browser extension. With that in mind, there are two main rules for contributing code or submitting issues:

1. **No major new features.** I have no plans or desire to implement new major features, besides those already listed on the [issues page](https://github.com/corbindavenport/wii-shop-extension/issues).
2. **No new music.** The extension already has 10 tracks included, and that will probably be it. The [ability to import custom music](https://github.com/corbindavenport/wii-shop-extension/issues/22) may be implemented in the future.

Future development on the extension will mainly focus on bug fixes, shopping website additions, and any changes required to keep up with evolving browser standards.
